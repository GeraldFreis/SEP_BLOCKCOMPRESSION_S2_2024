# Building

Bevy may require some extra dependancies if building on linux, they can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md). This will take a looong time to build the first time. The first argument is the input file for the compressor and the second is the output of the compressor.

```
Usage: visualiser <BASE_FILE> <INPUT>

Arguments:
  <BASE_FILE>  Path to the base file
  <INPUT>      Path to the compressed output

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```
